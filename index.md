# Welcome to My Portfolio

I am a Software Engineer passionate about the latest technologies. 

Linked below is a mock-up app that compares grocery prices across different stores. It was built with suggestions from Cursor and ChatGPT, and hosted on Firebase. Thanks to the help of AI, I was able to build this app in a couple of hours. What a time to be alive!
